                           Hello, my name is Akash SureshKumar, and I am from Chennai Tamil Nadu, currently pursuing Information Technology at SRM VALLIAMMAI engineering college in Chennai. I chose to study computer because I am driven by the fact that computer science has become a core component in the building of a better, brighter future for our planet, and my objective is to be a part of that process. I spend most of my spare time learning and designing programs as they challenge my problem-solving and logical thinking abilities. I am interested in new technology that arises regularly around the world, and I used to refer to myself as a tech enthusiast who loves and is fascinated by the technology around me. Some of the famous YouTubers like MKBHD and Linus tech tips are among my favorites. Discovering something new, maintaining a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and getting things done in a day are some of my habits. When it comes to programming, as a flexible and a quick learner am comfortable with all languages, but if I had to pick one as my personal favorite, I do go with Python because its more powerful and requires fewer lines of code. I dont like to settle, therefore Im always on the look for opportunities to improve myself and learn new things.

                    <div class=" content-text">
                        <p>Cyberpunk 2077 is a first-person action role-playing video game that was developed and maintained by CD Projekt Red. The game takes place in the year 2077 in an open world place called the night city. This was the biggest and most hyped video game of the entire decade, The game&rsquo;s teaser was launched on May 30, 2012, But the game officially launched after 8 years in 2020. After having so much hype for almost a decade and featuring Keanu Reeves (Hollywood actor) no one ever predicted that this game would be a total disaster. In a very best-case scenario, you got a buggy mess, ridiculous graphical glitches, random teleportation, people flying through walls, and pretty much anything and everything you can ever imagine, and even worst if you bought it for last-gen PlayStation 4 or Xbox one the graphical resolution and the detail of the game was terrible. Since the graphical requirements of this game were so high the old generation consoles couldn&rsquo;t handle it. But how did it come to be this way? After previously delaying Cyberpunk 2077 three times, developer CD Projekt Red stated that the company was &quot;too focused&quot; on releasing the game before the end of the year 2020. &quot;We underestimated the extent and complexity of the challenges, and we ignored the signals about the need for additional time to develop the game on the base last-gen consoles,&quot; Adam Kiciski, co-CEO of CD Projekt Red, stated during an investor call.</p>

<p>&nbsp;And it&#39;s not just the fact that this game wasn&#39;t even close to being ready when it launched,&nbsp;it&#39;s also the fact that the company behind it, CD Projekt Red, tried to hide it by restricting access to early copies so reviewers couldn&#39;t even warn people, so when it all became public, their stock price plummeted, they were destroyed on social media, and they were hit with multiple class-action lawsuits, with the company paying around $1.85 million to the unsatisfied. But the worst part is that these guys were maliciously hacked. It&#39;s tough to say whether it&#39;s related to the game or not, but it would be a pretty big coincidence if not. Someone broke into their server and stole everything they could find, including information about how the company operates, their employees, their accounts, and even the source code of the game, which can be used to create an unlimited number of new copies of it, and then the hackers sold all of that information. Moreover, the PlayStation company subsequently removed the digital version of the game which can be bought from their online store. This was ultimately one of the biggest video game disasters and the biggest disappointment that happened in the year 2020.</p>

                        <p>&quot;Machine intelligence is the final invention humans will ever require&quot; - Nick Bostrom</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A.I. has already replaced many jobs and is on its approach to replacing pilots, doctors, soldiers, and programmers. Art is one of humanity&#39;s last strongholds, or so we thought. But as of January 2022, digital artists and designers have been put on notice. Open A.I., the team behind GPT3, just announced DallE2, a neural network that can convert natural language into images, and it&#39;s some of the most insane technology we&#39;ve ever seen. Imagine I assigned you the task of drawing something bizarre, such as a bowl of soup that resembles a monster spray sprayed on a wall. Dalle can create realistic standard images that we&#39;ve never seen before from a simple text prompt like that. We get entirely different results if we tweet the request a little bit and ask it to look like plasticine. We can ask it for pencil drawings styles inspired by famous artists&#39; photo-realistic renderings and anything you can imagine because the A.I. is built on top of 40,000 years of human artwork dating back to Cave drawings. This program is not yet available to the public, but it can change things in current photographs. Some common examples include when you need to insert your ex-girlfriend into an Instagram post. It can also take one image as an input and then produce a variety of other variations with different styles and viewpoints. It&#39;s genuinely terrifying. I mean, it&#39;s fantastic, but how does it work? It&#39;s built on GPT3, the same paradigm enabling applications like GitHub copilot to write code. It was trained on a vast database of photos with label text descriptions.<br />
Most importantly, it understands how different objects in an image relate to one another, such as how a panda relates to a skateboard relates to New York relates to the world, etc. There&#39;s a paper titled hierarchical text conditional image generation with a clip if you want to go into more detail. Still, it&#39;s a decoder for a transformer that uses a process called diffusion that starts with a pattern of random pixels that are gradually moved around until they satisfy the text input to produce high-quality photographs. It generates 512 different probable outcomes before using a neural network called clip to forecast humanistic evaluations by ranking the outputs and discarding those that don&#39;t seem acceptable. It&#39;s pretty impressive and feels like a step closer to artificial intelligence. But what does a tool like this mean for the world? Here are my initial thoughts: businesses like Istock and Shutterstock could suffer remarkable if everyone could generate their original stock photos. Because this is effectively an automatic Photoshop, Photoshop as a tool may become far less necessary and engaging for a wider audience. When it comes to NFTs, which are oversaturated already, someone might suddenly flood the market with tonnes of original arts. How about website logo design? You can select your favorite logo and generate 1,000,000 unique variations with those logos. But, realistically, it is unlikely to replace designers anytime soon. Rather, it should be a handy tool for them, much like a copilot is for programmers. With a tool like this, I can see a lot of potential for abuse by making explicit or offensive stuff. Since this is not yet available to the general public usage, this is one of the most interesting and fascinating technology to look out for when it&#39;s released.<br />
With this technology, the line between the human and A.I. shrinks even more as they are now more powerful and capable of drawing on their own like humans which opens an entirely new field of research, interaction, and much more.</p>
